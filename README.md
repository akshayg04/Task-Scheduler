# Task-Scheduler
The provided Python program is a task scheduler using the APScheduler library. 

It allows users to schedule tasks to run at specific times or regular intervals. The key features of the program are as follows:

Task Scheduling: Users can schedule tasks to run at predefined times or intervals.

Specific Time Tasks: The program enables users to schedule tasks at specific times of the day, such as 2:30 PM. This is achieved using the 'cron' trigger from the APScheduler library.

Interval Tasks: Users can also schedule tasks to run at regular intervals, such as every 15 minutes.

Customizable: The code is flexible and can be customized to add more tasks, adjust scheduling settings, and specify different actions for each task.

User Interaction: The program waits for user input to exit gracefully, making it easy to start and stop scheduled tasks.
